This is model code from:

Werdel et al. (In Review) Landscape-scale effects structure carnivore communities in an agro-prairie ecosystem. Journal of Mammalogy.

It can be used to create an SEM of landscape influences on carnivore richness (Chao 2).

ChaoNumber.R is used to extract and transpose raw species incidence data to a usable format and then calculate the Chao 2 estimate for individual sites.

SEM_Revised.R is used to create the SEM and report the results.
